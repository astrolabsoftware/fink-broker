This section gathers Fink's common questions and commands.

## How to get Fink?

You need Python 3.6+, Apache Spark 2.4+, and docker-compose (latest) installed.
Define `SPARK_HOME`  as per your Spark installation (typically, `/usr/local/spark`) and add the path to the Spark binaries in `.bash_profile`:

```bash
# in ~/.bash_profile
# as per your spark installation directory (eg. /usr/local/spark)
export SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/spark
export SPARKLIB=${SPARK_HOME}/python:${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/py4j-0.10.7-src.zip
export PYTHONPATH=${SPARKLIB}:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=${SPARK_HOME}/bin:${SPARK_HOME}/sbin:${PATH}
```
Then execute the following (to ensure working of coverage module) :

```bash
echo "spark.yarn.jars=${SPARK_HOME}/jars/*.jar" >> ${SPARK_HOME}/conf/spark-defaults.conf
echo "spark.python.daemon.module coverage_daemon" >> ${SPARK_HOME}/conf/spark-defaults.conf
```

Set the path to HBase
```bash
# in ~/.bash_profile
# as per your hbase installation directory (eg. /usr/local/hbase)
export HBASE_HOME=/usr/local/hbase
export PATH=$PATH:$HBASE_HOME/bin
```

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astrolabsoftware/fink-broker.git
cd fink-broker
```

Then install the required python dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, define `FINK_HOME` and add the path to the Fink binaries and modules in your `.bash_profile` (assuming you are using `bash`...):

```bash
# in ~/.bash_profile
export FINK_HOME=/path/to/fink-broker
export PYTHONPATH=$FINK_HOME:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=$FINK_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Both the [dashboard](user_guide/dashboard.md) and the [simulator](user_guide/simulator.md) rely on docker-compose, and the [science database](user_guide/database.md) relies on HBase.

## Dashboard

### How to start the dashboard

The dashboard starts with

```bash
fink start dashboard
```

and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### How to change the port for the dashboard?

In the configuration `conf/fink.conf`, change the line:

```bash
FINK_UI_PORT=5000
```

### How to redirect ports to access the dashboard from a cluster?

You might need to redirect the port to get access to the dashboard:

```
# Assuming the port for the dashboard will be FINK_UI_PORT
ssh -L $FINK_UI_PORT:clustername:$FINK_UI_PORT username@clustername
# connection...
fink start dashboard
# Follow the URL (local redirection)
```

## Services

### How do I test the broker?

Just execute the test suite:

```
fink_test
```

You should see plenty of verbose logs from Apache Spark at screen (and yet we have shut most of them!), and finally the coverage.

### How do I start a service?

You can start a service by its name (assuming it is available):

```bash
fink start <service>
```

If you want to know which services are available:

```bash
fink
Handle Kafka stream received by Apache Spark

 Usage:
 	to start: fink start <service> [-h] [-c <conf>] [--simulator]
 	to stop : fink stop <service> [-h] [-c <conf>]

 To get this help:
 	fink

 To get help for a service:
 	fink start <service> -h

 To see the running processes:
  fink show

 Available services are: dashboard, checkstream, stream2raw, raw2science
 Typical configuration would be ${FINK_HOME}/conf/fink.conf
```

### How do I stop a service?

If you launch the service using

```bash
fink start <service>
```

just exit it using CTRL+C. If you put the service in the background, like

```bash
fink start <service> > service.log &
```

You can exit it using:

```bash
fink stop <service>
```

Note that currently this command will stop all services running (not just your service)... This will change soon.

### How do I put my service in the background while keeping the log?

Just redirect the output and escape:

```bash
fink start <service> > service.log &
```

### How do I get help on a service?

You easily get help on a service using:

```bash
fink start <service_name> -h
```

This will also tells you which configuration parameters can be used, e.g.

```shell
fink start stream2raw -h
usage: stream2raw.py [-h] [-servers SERVERS] [-topic TOPIC] [-schema SCHEMA]
                     [-startingoffsets_stream STARTINGOFFSETS_STREAM]
                     [-rawdatapath RAWDATAPATH]
                     [-checkpointpath_raw CHECKPOINTPATH_RAW]
                     [-checkpointpath_sci CHECKPOINTPATH_SCI]
                     [-science_db_name SCIENCE_DB_NAME]
                     [-finkwebpath FINKWEBPATH] [-tinterval TINTERVAL]
                     [-tinterval_kafka TINTERVAL_KAFKA]
                     [-exit_after EXIT_AFTER] [-datasimpath DATASIMPATH]
                     [-poolsize POOLSIZE]

Store live stream data on disk. The output can be local FS or distributed FS
(e.g. HDFS). Be careful though to have enough disk space! For some output
sinks where the end-to-end fault-tolerance can be guaranteed, you will need to
specify the location where the system will write all the checkpoint
information. This should be a directory in an HDFS-compatible fault-tolerant
file system. See also https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ structured-
streaming-programming-guide.html#starting-streaming-queries

                        data when building the raw database: latest, earliest,
                        or custom. [KAFKA_STARTING_OFFSET]

                        checkpoint information for the raw datable. This shoul
                        be a directory in an HDFS-compatible fault-tolerant
                        file system. See conf/fink.conf &
                        https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ structured-
                        streaming-programming-guide.html#starting-streaming-

                        checkpoint information for the science datable. This
                        should be a directory in an HDFS-compatible fault-
                        tolerant file system. See conf/fink.conf &
                        https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ structured-
                        streaming-programming-guide.html#starting-streaming-

                        primarily for use on Travis, to stop service after
                        some time. Use that with `fink start service
                        --exit_after <time>`. Default is None.
  -datasimpath DATASIMPATH
                        Folder containing simulated alerts to be published by
                        Kafka. [FINK_DATA_SIM]
  -poolsize POOLSIZE    Maximum number of alerts to send. If the poolsize is
                        bigger than the number of alerts in `datapath`, then
                        we replicate the alerts. Default is 5. [POOLSIZE]
```

### How do I see how many services are running?

You can easily see the running services by using:

```bash
fink show
1 Fink service(s) running:
USER               PID  %CPU %MEM      VSZ    RSS   TT  STAT STARTED      TIME COMMAND
julien           61200   0.0  0.0  4277816   1232 s001  S     8:20am   0:00.01 /bin/bash /path/to/fink start checkstream --simulator
Use <fink stop service_name> to stop a service.
Use <fink start dashboard> to start the dashboard or check its status.
```

### Spark's verbosity is overwhelming my logs!

Yes... By default Apache Spark outputs many many things - good for debug, but awful in production. In Fink we provide a utils to deal with Spark logs in your service:

```python
# inside your service
from fink_broker.sparkUtils import quiet_logs

# Your application
# ...

# Grab the running Spark Session,
# otherwise create it.
spark = SparkSession \
    .builder \
    .appName("classifyStream") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Set logs to be quieter (Just error messages)
# Put WARN or INFO for debugging, but you will have to dive into
# a sea of millions irrelevant messages for what you typically need...
quiet_logs(spark.sparkContext, log_level="ERROR")

# The rest of your application
# ...
```

### How can I test my service before production?

You can use it with the [simulator](simulator.md). See also the section [Testing Fink](testing-fink.md).

## Configuration

### How can I use a custom configuration?

Take inspiration from `conf/fink.conf`, and link your service to your custom configuration using

```bash
fink start <service> -c /path/my/custom_conf.conf
```

we recommend to not edit directly `conf/fink.conf`, but rather edit a copy of it.

## Apache Kafka

### How do I connect to a secured Kafka cluster?

First, you need to create a file (let's call it `jaas.conf`) with your username and password (assuming PLAINTEXT):

```java
// In jaas.conf
KafkaClient {
      org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required
       username="your_user_name_or_api_key"
        password="your_pwd";
 };
```

Then in the configuration file (assuming the `jaas.conf` is in the current directory), adds:

```bash
# in conf/myconf.conf
SECURED_KAFKA_CONFIG='--files jaas.conf
--driver-java-options "-Djava.security.auth.login.config=./jaas.conf"
--conf "spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-Djava.security.auth.login.config=./jaas.conf"'
```

You will find such a file in the folder `${FINK_HOME}/conf`

## Troubleshooting

### Failed to construct kafka consumer

This usually means there is no Kafka producer running at the `KAFKA_IPPORT` you specified in your [configuration](configuration.md). Check if there is no typo.

### The simulator is publishing alerts, but I do not see anything on the service side.

Make sure you use correctly the same `KAFKA_IPPORT_SIM` and `KAFKA_TOPIC_SIM` on both sides (simulator and service).


### fink: line 91: /conf/fink.conf: No such file or directory

You forgot to set `FINK_HOME`. The best is to add the path to Fink in your `.bash_profile`:

```bash
# in ~/.bash_profile
export FINK_HOME=/path/to/fink-broker
export PYTHONPATH=$FINK_HOME:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=$FINK_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

# Redistributing Alerts

One goal of the broker is to redistribute alert packets to the community. Therefore we have developed a service for streaming out alerts from the database to the world.

## Components

The two major components of Fink's distribution system are:

1. Kafka Cluster
2. Spark Process (which acts as the Producer)

## Kafka Cluster
The Kafka Cluster consists of one or more Kafka broker(s) and a Zookeeper server that monitors and manages the Kafka brokers.
It is important to note that the Kafka Cluster for Redistribution of alerts is different from the one used in [simulator](simulator.md).
<br>
You will need [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) 2.2+ installed. You can run the install script at `conf/install_kafka.sh`. Once installed, define `KAFKA_HOME` as per your installation in your ~/.bash_profile.

```bash
# in ~/.bash_profile
# as per your Kafka installation directory
export KAFKA_HOME=/usr/local/kafka
```
<br>
We provide a script `fink_kafka` to efficiently manage the Kafka Cluster for Redistribution. The help message shows the available
services:

```bash
Manage Finks Kafka Server for Alert Distribution

 Usage:
 	fink_kafka [option]

 Option:
 	start
 		Starts Zookeeper Server and a Kafka Cluster

 	stop
 		Stops the running Kafka Cluster and Zookeeper Server

 	-h, --help
 		To view this help message

 	--create-topic <TOPIC>
 		Creates a topic named <TOPIC> if it does not already exist
```

## Spark process
The Spark process is responsible for reading the alert data from the [Science Database](database.md#science-database-structure),
converting the data into avro packets and publishing them to Kafka topic(s).
<br>
To test the working of the distribution system, first start Fink's Kafka Cluster
and create a test topic:

```bash
# Start the Kafka Cluster
fink_kafka start
# Create a test topic
fink_kafka --create-topic distribution_test
```

This will start the Kafka Cluster and create a topic "distribution_test" if it didn't already exist.
Now, start the distribution service:

```bash
# Start the distribution service
fink start distribution
```
This results in the following:<br>

- A Spark process starts reading the Science Database. It scans the
database for new records and publish them to Kafka Servers.

- The records are converted to binary(avro) before they are published and the schema is stored at the path given in configuration:

```bash
DISTRIBUTION_SCHEMA=${FINK_HOME}/schemas/distribution_schema
```

This schema can be used by a consumer service to read and decode the Kafka messages. To learn more about configuring Fink see [configuration](configuration.md).
<br><br>
To check the working of the distribution pipelline we provide a Spark Consumer that reads the messages published
on the topic "distribution_test" and uses the schema above to convert them back to Spark DataFrame. This can be run using:

```bash
fink start distribution_test
```
This starts a Spark streaming process that reads the Kafka messages
published by the above distribution service, decodes them and print
the resulting DataFrame on console.

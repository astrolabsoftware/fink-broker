def get_kafka_df(df: DataFrame, key: str, elasticc: bool = False) -> DataFrame:
    """Create and return a df to pubish to Kafka

    For a kafka output the dataframe should have the following columns:
    key: (optional) Using a unique key can prevent reading duplicate data
        as Kafka supports "at least once" write semantics
        and might result in duplicate writing
    value: (required)
    topic: (*optional) if a topic field is not present in the dataframe
        it has to be given while writing to kafka

    This routine groups the DataFrame columns to be published to Kafka into
    a StructType column and convert it into avro(binary).
    To be able to decode the sent Kafka messages, the avro schema is stored
    at schema_path which is passed as an argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df: DataFrame
        A Spark DataFrame created after reading the science database (HBase)
    key: str
        Key to decode the alerts.
        Old: fbvsn_fsvsn
        New (>= 2023/01): full schema

    Returns
    -------
    df: DataFrame
        A Spark DataFrame with an avro(binary) encoded Column named "value"

    We first apply 3 criteria to select interesting candidates:

    1. remove alerts with possible counterpart in MPC
    2. remove alerts with negative fluxes
    3. keep only alerts with 1 detection

    Then, based on Sergey's analysis, we limit the analysis to
    the candidates outside the locus of variable stars (and bad subtractions).

    Returns

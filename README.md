## Getting started

Learning Fink is easy whether you are a developer or a scientist:

* Learn about the [broker technology](https://fink-broker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/broker/introduction/), the [science](https://fink-broker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/science/introduction/) we do, and how to [receive](https://fink-broker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fink-client/) alerts.
* Learn how to use the broker or how to contribute following the different [tutorials](https://fink-broker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/introduction/).
* Explore the different components:
    * [fink-alert-simulator](https://github.com/astrolabsoftware/fink-alert-simulator): Simulate alert streams for the Fink broker.
    * [fink-broker](https://github.com/astrolabsoftware/fink-broker): Astronomy Broker based on Apache Spark.
    * [fink-science](https://github.com/astrolabsoftware/fink-science): Define your science modules to add values to Fink alerts.
    * [fink-filters](https://github.com/astrolabsoftware/fink-filters): Define your filters to create your alert stream in Fink.
    * [fink-client](https://github.com/astrolabsoftware/fink-client):  Light-weight client to manipulate alerts from Fink.
